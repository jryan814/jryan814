### Hi,  
#### Iâ€™m @jryan814
I am a data/coding nerd...I have always loved automating processes in anyway that I can, and analyzing then visualizing data.  
Even in my non-tech roles I constantly was looking for ways to get my hands dirty with data analysis.
- I am currently in the process of finding my first data science/analyst position.
  - I have a very strong business acumen which pairs perfectly with my data science skills.  
  
I would love to collaborate on any project (but I would be most useful if it is related to Python or the data science realm.)
