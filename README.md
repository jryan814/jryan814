### Hi,  
#### Iâ€™m @jryan814  

I am a data/coding nerd...I have always loved automating processes, analyzing and visualizing data.   
Even in my non-tech roles I would put my data science and analytic skills to work taking on additional responsibilities to work with data and technology.  
A couple things about me:
  - 13+ years of operations management experience  
  - A very strong business acumen and operational knowledge (which pairs perfectly with my data science skillset)  
  - I am constantly looking for new projects, and am looking to jumpstart my career.  
- [datab-projects](http://github.com/jryan814/datab-projects) is my main data science repo.
